#3D Spheres with Depth of field

This is an experiment in creating a psuedo 3D environment with CSS.

Specifically, I wanted to try to use the blur filter to simulate depth of field. The basic concept overall uses Filter: Blur(), transform,  and boxshadow: inset (to enhance the effect).  Any tips or ideas on improvements are welcomed.
